The following additional files/directories need to be created:

* pcopr.confg - pcopr configuration file
See the https://github.com/pcmoore/copr-pkg_scripts project for information

* copr_config - Copr API token file
See https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/api for information

* pcopr_patch - symlink
Symlink to copr-pkg_scripts/pcopr_patch

* pcopr_srpm-kernel_rawhide - symlink
Symlink to copr-pkg_scripts/pcopr_srpm-kernel_rawhide

* kernel - Fedora kernel RPM repo
Create via 'git clone https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/kernel.git kernel'

* linux-sources - Linux Kernel source repositories
A Linux Kernel source repository with all of the remote trees you wish to use
to generate patches, plus Linus' tree stored with a remote name of 'linus'.
For example, on my system to build the kernel-secnext kernels I have the
following remotes: 'audit', 'selinux', and 'linus'.  I also have a local branch
named 'fixes' which I use to commit build fixes necessary to to build the
kernel.  More information can be found with the copr-pkg_scripts tools.
